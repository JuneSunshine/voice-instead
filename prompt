Tired of reading long text? why not convert text to speech so that you can hear the text on websites? 

This extension helps you select and speak text in your browser with the following two advantages:

(1) Voice Instead uses TTS(text to speech) engine in human voice quality. 

(2) Voice Instead supports extremely long text to be read by a single click without a long delay, and the speech is very smooth!

Usage: 
Select English text and simply click the `voice instead' item on the content page menu (right click). 
Click upper right popup icon to adjust speed and volume.

Note: Only English speech conversion is supported so far. And speech conversion on `https' session is not supported due to security reason.
